# WebIDE Offline

This repo folder contains the max version of WebIDE.

This comes with all the files and works completely offline.

These files also are the recommended files to be hosted on a webserver if you would like to do a OnPremise server.

> Note: These files in this directory are required, please do not delete any.
> Info: These files also do not redirect to www or http(s):// links which makes it work offline.
