# Data

> Note: also known as Analyzing data

At first my project had some bugs and it looked incorrect, then I linted my html code with a parser and it fixed most of my errors!

> Info:

```sh
Parser - In the case of programming languages, a parser is a component of a compiler or interpreter, which parses the source code of a computer programming language to create some form of internal representation; the parser is a key step in the compiler frontend.

Linter - A linter or lint refers to tools that analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. The term is originated from a Unix utility that examined C language source code.
```

Since I Did most of my coding using git on github, I can see data in the repository pulse!
